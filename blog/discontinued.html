			<h2>Nightweb is Discontinued</h2>
			<p>By Zach Oakes on March 31st, 2014</p>
			<p>Exactly one year ago, I released Nightweb, an anonymous social network. Today, I am officially halting development. I haven't been actively working on it for months, other than minor updates, but I always held out hope that I would get the motivation to continue. I didn't completely decide to stop until a few weeks ago.</p>
			<p>I had a great <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5468467">launch</a> on HN, topping the front page all day long, so I can only blame myself for the lack of interest afterwards. It's notable that I never received any pull requests other than for translations (which I am very grateful for). If I can't even interest other programmers, how can I expect to interest normal people?</p>
			<p>Of course, it's an esoteric kind of project (anonymous networking) written in an esoteric language (Clojure), so perhaps that shouldn't be a surprise. It was also frustratingly slow, and sometimes wouldn't retrieve new posts at all. BitTorrent over I2P is a tad bit more fragile and high latency than HTTP over a direct connection.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, though, it may have still succeeded if there was interesting content. One weakness in the design is that there was no discoverability; you only saw content from users you favorited, who you must find elsewhere out-of-band. To make matters worse, I made no effort to seed the client with interesting content by default.</p>
			<p>One final issue is that it really didn't do much. All it supported was writing posts and attaching photos. I eventually wanted to add support for attaching any files, no matter the type or size. I was already using BitTorrent to retrieve posts, so it was a logical next step. Maybe turning it into a full-fledged anonymous file-sharing network would've given people a reason to use it.</p>
			<p>I have adored cryptography and steganography since high school, and they are the original reason I became a programmer. My first publicly released software was a Firefox extension for steganography called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firesteg/">FireSteg</a>. Three years later I released a JavaScript equivalent called <a href="https://github.com/oakes/PixelJihad">PixelJihad</a>. A year after that, I released Nightweb.</p>
			<p>I'm proud of Nightweb and I don't regret the time I put into it, but for now, I'm too burnt out to continue. However, I'll still be working on <a href="https://nightcode.info/">Nightcode</a>, my Clojure IDE, and <a href="https://github.com/oakes/play-clj">play-clj</a>, my Clojure game library. I encourage everyone to use <a href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a> and contribute to the people behind it, whose work made Nightweb possible.</p>
