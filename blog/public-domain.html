			<h2>Why Your Next Project Should Be Public Domain</h2>
			<p>By Zach Oakes on July 10th, 2013</p>
			<p>I always dedicate <a href="https://github.com/oakes">my free software</a> to the public domain, and you should too. You may think that you are effectively doing that by using MIT, 2-clause BSD, Apache, or Eclipse, but you would be wrong. All of these licenses require interested parties to include a copy of their legalese anywhere the code is used. While not a particularly onerous requirement, many people (myself included) routinely violate it. Authors, thankfully, hardly ever pursue the issue, so why do they bother imposing the requirement?</p>
			<p>The more risk averse will caution against my suggestion, arguing that the public domain in the U.S. is too much of a legal gray area, and that permissive licenses are more legally "secure". Yet, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Cultivating_the_Public_Domain">until 1978</a>, one didn't even need to engage in the preposterous act of explicitly releasing one's work to the public domain; it was the default! Am I now being told that the grasp of copyright law has tightened so much that even an explicit renunciation is not enough to escape it?</p>
			<p>The issue <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5365975">has been debated</a>, and I often find people concluding that while it is still legally possible to dedicate one's work to the public domain, the small increase in risk isn't worth it. This is where I must remove my pragmatic software developer hat and replace it with nothing but the scalp I was born with: If the government under which I live has degraded the public domain this much, the relevant laws are not legitimate and I don't care to follow them.</p>
			<p>I completely understand those who find my internet bravado unconvincing. If I wasn't a single, childless, financially-poor man in his twenties, I might be more risk averse as well. I do not regard the LICENSE.txt in your Github project as a serious abrogation of ethics. It inspires more of a shallow sigh, like the kind you'd exhale if your male friend told you he cautiously avoids going to the park alone with his kid. I understand why you think that way, but it sucks that you think that way.</p>
			<p>Already, my generation is young enough to not know of a time when we didn't receive an automatic, unsolicited title to every creative thought we bothered to share. In my lifetime, I expect the copyright cancer to complete its metastasis. I expect that old-fashioned physical property rights will decline by the same magnitude. When I reach my deathbed and find myself ready to will that old-fashioned property to my unlikely-to-exist children, I'll be sure that document has a nice big public domain dedication at the bottom.</p>
